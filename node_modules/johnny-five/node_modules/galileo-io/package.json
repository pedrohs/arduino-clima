This project was built at [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com)\n\n### Getting Started\n\nGalileo-IO scripts are run directly from the Galileo or Edison board. To get started, complete the appropriate setup instructions: \n\n- [Galileo](http://rexstjohn.com/galileo-gen-2-setup/)\n- [Edison](http://rexstjohn.com/setting-up-intel-edison-with-intel-xdk/)\n\n\n### Installation\n\n```\nnpm install galileo-io\n```\n\nor \n\n```\nnpm install johnny-five\n```\n\n\n### Usage\n\nThis module can be used as an IO plugin for [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five).\n\n### Blink an Led\n\nThe \"Hello World\" of microcontroller programming:\n\n(attach an LED on pin 9)\n\n```js\nvar Galileo = require(\"galileo-io\");\nvar board = new Galileo();\n\nboard.on(\"ready\", function() {\n  var byte = 0;\n  this.pinMode(9, this.MODES.OUTPUT);\n\n  setInterval(function() {\n    board.digitalWrite(9, (byte ^= 1));\n  }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### Johnny-Five IO Plugin\n\nGalileo-IO is the default [IO layer](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/IO-Plugins) for [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) programs that are run on a Galileo or Edison board.\n\n\n### API\n\n**digitalWrite(pin, 1|0)**\n\n> Sets the pin to 1 or 0, which either connects it to 5V (the maximum voltage of the system) or to GND (ground).\n\nExample:\n```js\n// This will turn on the pin\nboard.digitalWrite(9, 1);\n```\n\n\n\n**analogWrite(pin, value)**\n\n> Sets the pin to a value between 0 and 255, where 0 is the same as LOW and 255 is the same as HIGH. This is sort of like sending a voltage between 0 and 5V, but since this is a digital system, it uses a mechanism called Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM. You could use analogWrite to dim an LED, as an example.\n\nExample:\n```js\n// Crank an LED to full brightness\nboard.analogWrite(9, 255);\n```\n\n**servoWrite(pin, value)** \n\n> Set the pin to a value between 0-180° to move the servo's horn to the corresponding position.\n\nExample:\n```js\nboard.servoWrite(9, 180);\n```\n\n**digitalRead(pin, handler)** Setup a continuous read handler for specific digital pin.\n\n> This will read the digital value of a pin, which can be read as either HIGH or LOW. If you were to connect the pin to 5V, it would read HIGH (1); if you connect it to GND, it would read LOW (0). Anywhere in between, it’ll probably read whichever one it’s closer to, but it gets dicey in the middle.\n\nExample:\n```js\n// Log all the readings for 9\nboard.digitalRead(9, function(data) {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n```\n\n\n**analogRead(pin, handler)** Setup a continuous read handler for specific analog pin.\n\n> This will read the analog value of a pin, which is a value from 0 to 4095, where 0 is LOW (GND) and 4095 is HIGH (5V). All of the analog pins (A0 to A5) can handle this. analogRead is great for reading data from sensors.\n\n\nExample:\n```js\n// Log all the readings for A1\nboard.analogRead(\"A1\", function(data) {\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\n```\n\n## License\nSee LICENSE file.\n\n",
